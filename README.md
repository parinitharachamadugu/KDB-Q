# KDB-Q


Kdb+ is a powerful database that can be used for streaming, real-time and historical data. Q is the SQL-like, general-purpose programming language built on top of kdb+. It offers high-performance, in-database analytic capabilities.

This project provides a glimpse into the available tools to work with CSV files and describes how kdb+ and its query language q raise CSV processing to a new level of performance and simplicity.


Fibonacci using q is a single liner

```
10 {x,sum -2#x}/ 1 1
```
